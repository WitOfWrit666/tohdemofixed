Finnigan, Not Finnegan, a short commentary concerning the proper usage of Finnigan in the context of the Finnigan Friday event and beyond.

"She Finnigans me, she Finnigans me not. She Finnigans me, she Finnigans me not..." - A dialogue exposing the "amoral" (amorality doesn't exist yet) dark passenger in lew of all women, of which they
are all due to submit to. 

It was of my own recent interest to recognize the prevailing errors in the discourse surrounding Finnigan Friday, specifically regarding the incorrect spelling of "Finnegan" when referencing the event 
or the figures surrounding it (I'm referring to the Finnigans). This is not a trivial matter, and in the pursuit of exposing veracity I will proceed to reveal the true nature of the word "Finnigan" 
in the simplest of terms possible, in the effort to dissuade transgressors against TOH mores. To begin, it would be best to define what the Finnigan isn't. The Finnigan is not an alternative spelling or 
pronounciation of the Gaelic surname Finnegan (though your preferred search engine of choice may attempt to justify otherwise). The spelling of Finnigan is unique in it's own regard because it adheres 
only to it's own regard. I will now present before you a definite definition of Finnigan:

Finnigan - An animal (especially a mammal) that demonstrates an intentional Faustian character or an unconscious ambition to kill for the sake of.

The Finnigan tradition, as previously stated, is not especially keen to associate itself with the works of the Magian (or anyone else for that matter), and is an animal of few morals (and words).
The Finnigan is primal and acts on a whim, thus (and I mean, obviously) bearing no relation to the Finnegan, the (presumably) astute; born of the repressor of evolution, 

The intellectual civilization.

Yours truly,
